[To Make Delicious Poha, Follow Step By Step] 
 
 
 Collect all the required ingredients.

Place the Poha in a colander and rinse it well under running water. Stir the Poha gently by using your fingers while rinsing, otherwise, they will become mushy at the time of cooking. Once washed set aside the Poha.

Heat oil in a kadai, add the mustard and allow it to crackle.

Add peanuts in the pan and cook it on low flame till the peanut is cooked properly and nice aroma comes from the peanuts.

Add onion and cook for another 1-2 minutes on low-medium flame till onions are translucent in the color.

Once the onions have softened, add carrot, capsicum and peas cook for 2-3 minutes on low-medium flame.

Further, add boiled potato and tomato and cook for another 1 minute.

Now, add curry leaves, green chili, salt, red chili powder, turmeric and mix it well with the veggies.

Furthermore, lower the flame and add the soft washed flattened rice (chiwda) to the pan and give the poha a gentle stir until all the ingredients come together.

Turn off the flame once the flattened rice (chiwda) is mixed well with the vegetables.

Add coriander leaves and mix it. Check the salt and seasonings and adjust to suit your taste and serve.

(TIP : Serve Vegetable Poha along with a hot cup of Adrak Chai for a wholesome breakfast)
